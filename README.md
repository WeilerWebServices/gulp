Flexible

Using code over configuration, utilize all of JavaScript to create your gulpfile---where tasks can be written using your own code or chained single purpose plugins.

---

Composable

Write individual, focused tasks and compose them into larger operations, providing you with speed and accuracy while reducing repetition.

---

Efficient

By using gulp streams, you can apply many transformations to your files while in memory before anything is written to the disk---significantly speeding up your build process.

Connecting plugins

Using community-built plugins is a quick way to get started with gulp. Each plugin does a small amount of work, so you can connect them like building blocks. Chain together plugins from a variety of technologies to reach your desired result.
